    <p>I like fortnite. What is Fortnite Battle Royale?
      Fortnite
      
      Fortnite is a survival game where 100 players fight against each other in player versus player combat to be the last one standing. It is a fast-paced, action-packed game, not unlike The Hunger Games, where strategic thinking is a must in order to survive. There are an estimated 125 million players on Fortnite.
      
      How Does Fortnite Work?
      
      
      Players skydive onto a small island, are equipped with an axe and must scavenge for more weapons, while simultaneously avoiding a killer electrical storm. As players are eliminated, the field of play also gets smaller, meaning players are put closer together. Updates regularly flash on screen detailing how another player was killed “X killed Y with a grenade”, adding to the sense of urgency. While the game is free to play, you do need to create an account with Epic Games.

      To make this easier users can use their Google or Facebook accounts to log in with Epic Games, or users can create a new account. To get the game started and get on board the “Battle Bus”, you will need to download Epic Games. You are randomly assigned an avatar each time you play the game, regardless of your own gender. Gamers can choose what mode they would like to play in, solo, duo mode or in a squad. You can add friends to your squad and play as a team. When you are ready, you can select play to start the game.

      Why Do Children Like it?
      
      
      Fortnite Battle Royale is a game of survival, which means in order to win, you must defeat the other 99 online players in the game. This competitive element adds a touch of urgency to the game, gamers also need to avoid being caught in the eye of the storm to remain in the game, there are regular countdowns to when the storm is approaching.
      
      The games colourful animations and the graphics will appeal to younger users. Epic Games quite cleverly tease gamers with new updates, new offers and new ways to play. Fortnite will soon be released on mobile devices. Users can unlock new items for free by continuing to play the game free of charge, and vc.
      
      There is also a degree of fun to the game with Christmas and dinosaur costumes available for purchase. Avatars can also do dance moves, using the ‘Emote‘ feature, these can be activated during the game which can be quite amusing. Many of these dances are inspired by popular culture, enabling gamers to enjoy them both in the game or in the schoolyard.
      
      There is a social element to the game, users can play in groups or two or more and chat to each other on headsets or text chat during the game. Fortnite has become the most viewed game in history on YouTube. There are a number of popular social media influencers or YouTube personalities who also play the game and provide tutorials on how to achieve a higher score., </p>
      <h3>Soccer</h3>
      <p>Football, game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal. Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. The team that scores more goals wins. I am a competitive soccer player who currently plays as a winger. It is fun because I can score goals while remaining an integral part of the defense. </p>
      <h3>Basketball</h3>
      <p>Basketball, game played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court, usually indoors. Each team tries to score by tossing the ball through the opponent’s goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and net called a basket. I play basketball for fun and my aim is to be able to dunk and maybe make the school basketball team helping me become a well rounded athlete.</p>
